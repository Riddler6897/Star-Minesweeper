# Star-Minesweeper
A minesweeper game where the user will try to unveil the different constellations on the grid before the 20 minute timer runs out.
There are 10 levels and each level gets harder than the last.
Each time the player hits a mine, it will restart the current level.
Game requires good memorization skills and patience.
